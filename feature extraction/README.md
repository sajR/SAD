# Feture Extraction
The networks utilise mouth-region images to detect speech. This is done so less noise is intrdocued to the network which can be the case of using full face images.

Extraction of mouth-region images by using Haar Cascade and heuristics. The Haar cascade idenitfies the face in the image, once found, calculations are done to obtain mouth-region image.

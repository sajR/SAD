# Feture Extraction
The networks utilise mouth-region images to detect speech. This is done so less noise is introduced to the network which can be the case of using full-face images.

Extraction of mouth-region images by using Haar Cascade and heuristics. The Haar cascade identifies the face in the image, once found calculations are done to obtain a mouth-region image.
